# On startup and on the shutdown.

# Change this if your server has a diffrent time that your users.
# eg.: ServerTime: 16:43 | Your Time: 13:43 | TimeDiff has to be set to -3
# You can check the server time with /systemPerfs
TimeDiff: 0

# This commands will be disabled for muted players
# A player woun't be able to bypass with eg "/minectaft:me"
MuteCommands:

# If you use extern REST-APIs they will have to respond in JSON
# The given APIs will only be used for NAME -> UUID
# For UUID -> NAME will either the official MojangAPI or the InternFetcher be used!
# To check if you can use the intern fetcher do /systemPerfs and compare your uuid
#   to the one you can see online on http://NamesMC.com
#   if they are similar we recommend using the InternFetcher
UUID-Fetcher:
  # If dynamic it set to true it will override the 'enabled' and 'intern' settings
  # and automatically detect the best possible uuid fetcher settings for your server.
  # Our recommendation: don't set dynamic to false if you don't have any problems.
  Dynamic: true
  Enabled: false
  Intern: false
  REST-API:
    URL: "https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/%NAME%?at=%TIMESTAMP%"

  BackUp-API:

    Key: "uuid"

# These are the commands that will be performed on warns
# If you skip a number the command from before will be performed

WarnActions:
  3: "kick %PLAYER% &c&oYou have received your 3rd warning!"
  4: "tempban %PLAYER% 30m &c&oYou have received your 4th warning!"
  5: "tempban %PLAYER% 5h &c&oYou have received your 5th warning!"
  6: "tempban %PLAYER% 7d &c&oYou have received your 6th warning!"
  7: "tempban %PLAYER% 1mo &c&oYou have received your %COUNT%th warning!"

# Here you can create permission-nodes for max-punishment-duration.
# The permission "ab.tempban.dur.1" would allow the player to ban max. for 600sec = 10min
# The permission "ab.tempwarn.dur.2" would allow the player to warn max. for 3600sec = 1h
# You can only create up to 10 perms. The perms can be overridden with "ab.COMMAND.dur.max"
TempPerms:
  1: 600
  2: 3600
  3: 43200

# This is useful for bungeecord servers or server with permission systems which do not support *-Perms
# So if you enable this you can use ab.all instead of ab.* or ab.ban.all instead of ab.ban.*
# This does not work with negative permissions! e.g. -ab.all would not block all commands for that user.
EnableAllPermissionNodes: false
