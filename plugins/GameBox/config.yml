# define the language file you want to use (find the default files in the folder 'language')
#   to use the default messages just write 'default' (this option uses a file from inside the jar!)
#   you cannot customise messages when using 'default', but your messages will always be up to date
# If you want custom messages please write your own file or use one of the already written 'lang_xx.yml' files
# If an update added new messages that are not in your defined file the plugin will print a warning and a list
#   of missing paths and will use the corresponding default messages until you added them in your file
#   To get an up to date language file just delete one of the included files and reload
